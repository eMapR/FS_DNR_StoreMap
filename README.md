# FS_DNR_StoryMap

This story map adds visual and geo-spatial depth to an already interesting story of forest dynamics. In August of 2022 the Emapr Lab and its partners from the Forest Service and Washington Stateâ€™s Department of Natural Resources went out into the field to investigate modeled change detection efforts. These efforts endeavor to model the location of forest defoliation and mortality caused by various agents in the landscape. Thus, heading off into the forest with some forest health pros was the next best step to see how the model performed and understand edge cases.

With maps in hand we head north from Oregon State University to the eastside of the Washington Cascades to explore known locations of defoliation and mortality. These locations were outlined by Region 6 Forest Service Aerial Detection Survey (ADS), which have the difficult job of flying over all forested regions of Washington and Oregon to identify locations of defoliation and mortality. Thus, the ADS polygons seemed like a good place to get a feel for how our model performed. 

This repo is the landing point for all the code and assets it takes to build such a story map.
